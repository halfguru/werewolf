One by one theyll kill off villagers and win when there are either the same number of villagers and werewolves left, or all the villagers have died. This role is the hardest of all to maintain, because these players are lying for the duration of the game.'

    description:
    'The Seer, while first and foremost a villager, has the added ability to "see" who the werewolves are once night falls. When called awake by the Moderator, the Seer can point to any of their fellow players and the Moderator must nod yes or no as to whether or not they are indeed a Werewolf. The Seer can then choose to keep this information a secret during the day, or reveal themselves as the Seer and use the knowledge they gained during the night in their defense or to their advantage during the day.'

    description:
    'Also a villager, the Doctor has the ability to heal themselves or another villager when called awake by the Moderator during the night. Should they heal themselves, then will be safe from being killed by the werewolves, or should they want to prove themselves the Doctor or fear the death of a fellow villager, can opt to heal them instead.'

    description:
    'The Witch will point to the person they want to poison or bring back to life. While the Witch can only use their potion and poison once, each action must be said each night to retain anonymity as to what has been done. They can only use one per evening until both are gone, and have the ability to save them until a point in the game they deem fit.'
